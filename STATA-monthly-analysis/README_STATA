This folder contains files written in STATA and R programming languages. The included files are representative and exemplary only; they do not contain the full code used in my thesis. Their purpose is to guide and illustrate Difference-in-Differences (DiD) modeling approaches in STATA. 
Please treat this code as inspiration, not as a complete or ready-to-use solution.
