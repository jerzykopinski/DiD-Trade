Scripts for conducting HS-level (Harmonized System) trade analysis using a Triple Difference (DDD) approach.

Analyzes the impact of sanctions on trade at the product level (HS codes), distinguishing between sanctioned and non-sanctioned goods.
Constructs a triple interaction term: RUSSIA × POST × SANCTIONED.
Estimates models with various fixed effects:
Model 1: Fixed effects for country-pair, year, and HS code.
Model 2: Fixed effects for HS code only.

Separate models are estimated for exports and imports.
Uses reghdfe with clustered standard errors.

⚠️ Note: These scripts are computationally intensive and may take several hours to run on large datasets.
